"""
Push your predictions to a PRIVATE Hugging Face repo and write the pointer manifest for Codabench.

This is the RECOMMENDED submission route. Instead of uploading ~1.9 GB to Codabench, you push the
.npz to a private Hugging Face dataset repo and submit a small manifest.json naming a pinned
commit plus a read token scoped to that one repo. The scorer pulls from Hugging Face's CDN.

Why it is worth the extra step, measured from the scoring machine:

    Codabench file storage   ~0.5 MB/s   ->  a 1.9 GB submission spends ~1 h in transfer
    Hugging Face CDN         ~50 MB/s    ->  the same predictions arrive in under a minute

The scoring worker runs one job at a time, so that hour is queue time everyone shares.

The repo stays PRIVATE -- your predictions are never visible to other teams.

The FIRST run is two steps, because Hugging Face cannot scope a token to a repo that does not
exist yet:

    # 1. create the private repo (nothing is uploaded)
    uv run python push_predictions.py --repo your-username/fusion-eq-predictions
    # 2. scope a read token to it (the script prints how), then upload for real
    uv run python push_predictions.py --repo your-username/fusion-eq-predictions --read-token hf_...

Every run after that is just step 2.

You need TWO tokens, both from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens :

  1. A WRITE token, to upload. Log in with it once:  uv run huggingface-cli login
     It never leaves your machine. Note you can only create repos in a namespace you own --
     use your own username unless you have write access to the organization.
  2. A FINE-GRAINED READ token scoped to your predictions repo ONLY. This one goes into
     manifest.json and is submitted, so the scorer can read your private repo. Pass it with
     --read-token or set HF_READ_TOKEN.

     New token -> Fine-grained -> under "Repository permissions" pick your predictions repo
     -> tick "Read access to contents of selected repos" -> nothing else. Scoping it to your
     whole username instead works, but hands over read access to all your private repos.

This script REFUSES a write token or a classic read token for #2, because both grant far more
than the scorer needs and both are stored with your submission. Revoke the read token after the
competition.
